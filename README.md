# GetHTTPstatusCode
This Script was created for the monitoring department. 
This scripts pulls URL's from an excel spread sheet performs a get request and returns the HTTP status code of that website. This was done
in an effort to prevent unneded manual effort. 
This was also the starting point of the project. Future enhancements involved meshing with solarwinds so that solarwinds can notify the correct personal if the http status code should return an invalid/unwanted code.
